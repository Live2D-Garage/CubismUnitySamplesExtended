# Following

This sample demonstrates the ability to make an object follow a specific mesh in a Cubism model.
By adding the CubismFollowing component to the mesh, you can specify the object you want to track as the Target and set the position relationship between the Target and the mesh using the Offset.
In the Following scene, the Clipping object is already set to follow the left hand of the model.
